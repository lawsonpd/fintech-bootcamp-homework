# Predicting stocks with LSTM (long short-term memory) neural networks

## Overview

In this experiment, we compare two RNNs (recursive neural networks) trained to predict BTC (Bitcoin) closing prices. The target values, namely the closing prices, are identical for both RNNs, but the training sets are different: FNG ("Fear and greed") values for one, and prior closing prices for the other.
