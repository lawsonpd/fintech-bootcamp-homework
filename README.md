# Peter Lawson's homework from Vanderbilt University FinTech Bootcamp (summer-fall 2020)

_For details about the program, see [Program Info](#Program-Info) below._

This bootcamp was exciting and inspiring. The fintech and data science frontier will continue to unfold and evolve in myriad ways. I'm eager to explore the real-world landscape with these powerful new tools and ways of thinking about business problems. I completed the bootcamp with a broad, practical understanding of how coding and data analysis can be used to make more sophisticated and informed business decisions. It was also amazing to enter the strange world of cryptocurrencies and de-fi and see how these new technologies challenge the way we think about programming and economics.

## Overview

This repo holds the majority of the work I did for the 24-week bootcamp. There were weekly individuals assignments and group projects; the group projects and some assignments are housed in separate repos (links are provided).

There are several files in each of the weekly folders, so below I've provided links to the main files containing my coded solution(s).

Many assignments were made using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. Github will render these as static notebook layouts, so they typically take a few seconds to load when viewing in Github.

### Weeks 8 & 9: Group project I

In this group project we developed a scenario in which a portfolio manager was tasked with selecting one of a handful of portfolios, given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used ante- and intra-COVID stock price data to simulate future prices. 

My task was to build a module that, given a list of stock tickers (i.e. an investment portfolio), analyzes the predicted returns of the portfolio based on an aggregation of Monte Carlo simulations.

### Weeks 16 & 17: Group project II

The second project was conceived as an continuance of project I. Using the additional tools of machine learning and natural language processing, we created a chatbot interface that would allow a hypothetical investor to choose an arbitrary portfolio of stocks. Behind the scenes, we retrieved stock data from an API and predicted future prices.

My role in this project was to build the machine learning module that retrieves prices, creates price models using a long-term short-term neural network and returns the prediction data to the chatbot.

### Weeks 23 & 24: Group project III

For the final project, we conceived of a crowdfunding model that would let a startup raise funds by selling Ethereum ERC20 fungible tokens. After the funds are raised, a portion of the ETH (Ethereum's native currency) would be converted to a stable coin, which could be used by the startup to fund operations, and the rest would be lent on the Compound system whereby it would earn interest. At some time down the line the tokens would be converted back to ETH, which would be returned to the crowdfunders.

I helped write the Solidity contracts that embody the logic of our crowdfund model.
