# Peter Lawson's homework from Vanderbilt University FinTech Bootcamp (summer-fall 2020)

_Updated June 15, 2020_

_For details about the program, see [Program Info](#Program-Info) below._

This bootcamp has been exciting and inspiring. The fintech and data science frontier will continue to unfold and evolve in myriad ways. I'm eager to explore the real-world landscape with these powerful new tools and ways of thinking about business problems. I intend to maintain my current 3.9 GPA and complete the bootcamp with a broad, practical understanding of how coding and data analysis can be used to make more sophisticated and informed business decisions.

## Overview

This repo holds the majority of the work I did for the 24-week bootcamp. There were weekly individuals assignments and group projects; the group projects are housed in separate repos (links are provided).

There are several files in each of the weekly folders, so below I've provided links to the main notebook(s) containing my coded solution(s). The instructional file for each notebook can be found as a readme.md file in the same folder.

All assignments were made using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. Github will render these as static notebook layouts, so they typically take a few seconds to load when viewing in Github.

### Weeks 8 & 9: Group project I

In this group project we developed a scenario in which a portfolio manager was tasked with selecting one of a handful of portfolios, given the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used ante- and intra-COVID stock price data to simulate future prices. 

My task was to build a module that, given a list of stock tickers (i.e. an investment portfolio), analyzes the predicted returns of the portfolio based on an aggregation of Monte Carlo simulations.

### Weeks 16 & 17: Group project II

The second project was conceived as an continuance of project I. Using the additional tools of machine learning and natural language processing, we created a chatbot interface that would allow a hypothetical investor to choose an arbitrary portfolio of stocks. Behind the scenes, we retrieved stock data from an API and predicted future prices.

My role in this project was to build the machine learning module that retrieves prices, creates price models using a long-term short-term neural network and returns the prediction data to the chatbot.
